Writing my first redcar plugin

I really like the idea of redcar the fact the editor is written in ruby and you can write plugins in ruby relaly attract me to this editor, though I must confess I do not use it as my day to day editor. I wonder if writting my own plugins will turn redcar into my go to editor. Let see how easy it is to write plugin.

First follow the install instructions here (https://github.com/redcar/redcar/wiki/installation)

Whats the big idea
The idea for my first plugin is very ambitious I'd like to refresh a browser web page when ever I save a change to its source.

Followed the guides found here
